# TerraWeek Day 5


## Task 1: 
- What are **modules** in Terraform and why do we need modules in Terraform?
- What are the benefits of using modules in Terraform?

## Task 2:

## Task 3: 
- Dig into **modular composition** and **module versioning**.

## Task 4: 
- What are the ways to **lock Terraform module versions**? Explain with code snippets.
